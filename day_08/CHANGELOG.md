## [1.0.0] - 2024-12-XX

### üéâ Initial Production Release

This is the first production-ready release of the Enhanced Token Analysis System, featuring a complete transformation from prototype to enterprise-grade architecture.

### ‚ú® Added

#### Core Features
- **Accurate Token Counting**: Multiple strategies (simple estimation, ML-based, hybrid)
- **Advanced Compression**: Strategy pattern with truncation, keywords, extractive, semantic, and summarization
- **Robust ML Integration**: Retry logic, circuit breaker, and request validation
- **Comprehensive Experiments**: Builder pattern for experiment results with structured logging

#### Architecture & Design Patterns
- **Clean Architecture**: Domain, Application, Infrastructure, and Presentation layers
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Entities, value objects, repositories, and domain services
- **SOLID Principles**: Single responsibility, dependency injection, interface segregation
- **Design Patterns**: Strategy, Factory, Builder, Template Method, Circuit Breaker, Facade

#### ML Engineering Framework
- **Model Evaluation**: `ModelEvaluator` with MAE, RMSE, compression quality metrics
- **Performance Monitoring**: `PerformanceMonitor` with drift detection and alerting
- **Experiment Tracking**: `ExperimentTracker` with hyperparameters and metrics tracking
- **Model Registry**: `ModelRegistry` with versioning and production promotion workflow

#### Domain Layer (Phase 7)
- **Domain Entities**: `TokenAnalysisDomain`, `CompressionJob`, `ExperimentSession`
- **Value Objects**: `TokenCount`, `CompressionRatio`, `ModelSpecification`, `ProcessingTime`, `QualityScore`
- **Repositories**: Abstract repository interfaces for data access
- **Domain Services**: Complex business logic encapsulation

#### Quality Assurance
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 282 tests with 74% coverage
- **Structured Logging**: Replaced all print statements with contextual logging
- **Type Safety**: 100% type hints coverage in core modules
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception hierarchy
- **Security**: Input validation and sanitization throughout

#### Development Tools
- **SOLID Audit Tool**: `tools/solid_audit.py` for architectural compliance
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Automated quality checks
- **Linting**: mypy, pylint, ruff, bandit integration
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and API reference

### üîß Changed

#### SOLID Refactoring (Phase 5)
- **PerformanceMonitor**: Split into `MetricsCollector`, `DriftDetector`, `AlertManager`, `PerformanceAnalyzer`
- **SimpleTokenCounter**: Refactored into `TokenCalculator`, `LimitChecker`, `ModelConfigProvider`, `TokenCounterFacade`
- **TokenCounter**: Enhanced with dependency injection and single responsibility

#### API Improvements
- **Configuration Injection**: All components now require configuration
- **Unified Compression**: Single `compress_text()` method with strategy parameter
- **Enhanced Data Models**: More fields in `TokenInfo`, `CompressionResult`, `ExperimentResult`
- **Builder Pattern**: `ExperimentResultBuilder` for complex object construction

#### Architecture Evolution
- **Layer Separation**: Clear boundaries between domain, application, and infrastructure
- **Dependency Management**: Proper dependency injection throughout
- **Error Handling**: Structured exceptions instead of generic errors
- **Logging**: Contextual logging with structured data

### üöÄ Performance

- **Token Counting**: ~0.1ms per 1000 characters
- **Text Compression**: ~5ms per 10KB text
- **ML Requests**: ~200ms average response time
- **Memory Usage**: ~50MB baseline

### üìä Metrics

- **Test Coverage**: 74% (282 tests passing)
- **Code Quality**: 85%+ functions ‚â§15 lines
- **Type Safety**: 100% type hints coverage
- **Architecture**: 6 design patterns implemented
- **SOLID Compliance**: High-severity violations eliminated

### üîÑ Migration Notes

#### Breaking Changes
- **Configuration Required**: All components now need configuration injection
- **Method Signatures**: Some methods have additional parameters
- **Compression API**: Unified `compress_text()` method replaces separate strategy methods
- **Error Handling**: Structured exceptions replace generic error handling

#### Migration Path
1. Update imports to include configuration classes
2. Pass configuration to component constructors
3. Use unified compression method with strategy parameter
4. Handle specific exception types instead of generic exceptions
5. Replace print statements with structured logging
