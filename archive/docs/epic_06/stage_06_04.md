# Stage 06_04 · Final Verification & Hand-off

## Goal
Validate the cleaned repository, capture lessons learned, and prepare maintainers
for ongoing operations.

## Checklist
- [ ] Compile final verification report (tests, automation runs, doc navigation
  checks).
- [ ] Produce maintainer playbook covering repository layout, automation entry
  points, and escalation paths.
- [ ] Host (or record) a walkthrough for future maintainers; capture Q&A.
- [ ] Update programme tracker and progress docs; archive Stage artefacts as
  reference.
- [ ] Secure stakeholder sign-offs (architecture, ops, docs, QA).

## Deliverables
- Final verification summary stored in `docs/specs/epic_06/stage_06_04_summary.md`.
- Maintainer playbook and onboarding checklist (`docs/MAINTAINERS_GUIDE.md` or
  equivalent).
- Signed-off checklist with approvals recorded in `signoff_log.md`.

## Metrics & Evidence
- Links to CI runs, automation logs, and doc checkers demonstrating success.
- Attendance/confirmation from walkthrough session.
- Documentation diff summary showing final updates.

## Dependencies
- Completion of Stage 06_03 automation and quality tasks.
- Stakeholder availability for sign-off and walkthrough.

## Exit Criteria
- All deliverables published and accessible.
- Stakeholder approvals captured; maintainers acknowledge readiness.
- Residual backlog items (if any) re-homed to future roadmap with owners.

## Open Questions
- Should we schedule periodic repository hygiene checks (e.g., quarterly)?
- Do we need to formalise release cadence post-cleanup?
