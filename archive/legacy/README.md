# Legacy Code Archives

This directory contains archived code from the earlier phases of the AI Challenge project.

## Contents

- **day_05/**: Multi-model support implementation
- **day_06/**: Model testing and riddle evaluation
- **day_07/**: Multi-agent architecture and communication
- **day_08/**: Token analysis and compression

## Status

These directories have been **archived** and are no longer actively maintained. They are kept for reference and historical purposes.

The code from these directories has been successfully migrated to the new Clean Architecture structure in Phase 2:

- Agent functionality → `src/domain/agents/`
- Infrastructure → `src/infrastructure/`
- Tests → `src/tests/`
- Configuration → `config/`

## Migration Notes

All essential functionality from these legacy directories has been:
- ✅ Refactored into Clean Architecture layers
- ✅ Updated to use new message schemas
- ✅ Tested with comprehensive unit and integration tests
- ✅ Documented in the main project documentation

## Purpose

These archives serve as:
1. Reference for understanding the evolution of the codebase
2. Examples of different implementation approaches
3. Historical record of project development

## Usage

If you need to reference legacy code:

```bash
# Navigate to legacy directories
cd archive/legacy/day_XX

# Check specific functionality
ls -la
```

## Important

⚠️ **Do not import or use legacy code in new development.**  
Always use the new Phase 2 architecture instead.
