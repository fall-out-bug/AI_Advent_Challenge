# Changelog

All notable changes to the AI Challenge project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Refactored `summary_worker.py` (700 lines → 258 lines) into modular structure:
  - Extracted `formatters.py` for message formatting (format_summary, format_single_digest, clean_markdown)
  - Extracted `message_sender.py` for message sending with retry logic and error handling
  - Extracted `data_fetchers.py` for data fetching (get_summary_text, get_digest_texts)
  - Improved code readability and maintainability following Clean Architecture principles
- Updated tests to use new modular structure

### Fixed
- Implemented TODO in `client.py`: added tool call parsing in interactive mode (supports JSON and key=value formats)

## [Day 12] - 2025-01-XX

### Added
- PDF digest generation via MCP tools (`get_posts_from_db`, `summarize_posts`, `format_digest_markdown`, `combine_markdown_sections`, `convert_markdown_to_pdf`)
- Post collection worker (`PostFetcherWorker`) with hourly schedule for automatic post collection from subscribed Telegram channels
- Hybrid deduplication system (message_id + content_hash) to prevent duplicate posts
- PDF caching mechanism with 1-hour TTL for improved performance
- Post repository (`PostRepository`) with MongoDB integration and TTL support (7 days)
- PDF digest bot handler with automatic fallback to text digest on errors
- Comprehensive test suite: 63 tests (40 unit, 6 integration, 5 E2E, 12 contract tests)
- PDF digest API documentation (`docs/day12/api.md`)
- PDF digest user guide (`docs/day12/USER_GUIDE.md`)
- PDF digest architecture documentation with Mermaid diagrams (`docs/day12/ARCHITECTURE.md`)

### Changed
- Digest generation now reads from MongoDB instead of Telegram API (faster, more reliable)
- `get_channel_digest` updated to use database queries instead of direct API calls
- `fetch_channel_posts` now supports automatic saving to database via repository
- Settings extended with PDF-related configuration (`pdf_cache_ttl_hours`, `pdf_summary_sentences`, `pdf_summary_max_chars`, `pdf_max_posts_per_channel`)

### Fixed
- Post deduplication prevents duplicate entries in database
- Error handling improved with graceful fallback mechanisms
- Empty digest handling with informative user messages

### Performance
- PDF caching reduces regeneration time (instant delivery on cache hit)
- MongoDB indexes optimize post queries
- Limits prevent token overflow (max 100 posts per channel, max 10 channels)

## [Day 11] - 2025-01-XX

### Added
- FSM-based conversation flow for multi-turn task creation
- Clarifying questions for ambiguous task inputs
- Enhanced intent orchestrator with context-aware parsing (Russian/English)
- Domain value objects for task summary and digest formatting (`TaskSummary`, `DigestMessage`)
- Comprehensive test suite: unit, integration, E2E, and contract tests
- MCP tools API documentation with examples (`docs/API_MCP_TOOLS.md`)
- Architecture diagrams for FSM flow (`docs/ARCHITECTURE_FSM.md`)
- Quick start guide for Day 11 features (`docs/QUICK_START_DAY11.md`)
- Telegram bot menu integration with summary and digest callbacks
- State persistence middleware for FSM conversations
- Natural language task creation with intent parsing

### Changed
- Refactored `reminder_tools.py`: extracted query builder and stats calculator into helpers
- All functions now ≤15 lines (extracted from large functions)
- Improved Russian language support in intent parsing
- Menu summary/digest handlers now fully functional via MCP tools
- Enhanced error handling with user-friendly messages

### Fixed
- Missing `asyncio` import in `summarizer.py` (line 246)
- Debug print statements replaced with structured logging
- Timezone handling in `get_summary` simplified
- Overdue task calculation (excludes completed tasks)

### Performance
- Token cost reduced through helper extraction
- Test coverage maintained at 76%+ (target: 80%+)
