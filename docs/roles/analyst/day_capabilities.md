# Analyst Day Capabilities

## Foundational Days 1-22

### Days 1-10 · Discovery Primer
- Stand up requirement templates and traceability matrices.
- Establish acceptance criteria catalog shared with Architect and Tech Lead.
- Document archive rules and review cadence checkpoints.

### Day 11 · Shared Infra & MCP Baseline
- Capture infra assumptions (Mongo, Prometheus, Grafana, LLM API).
- Align requirement acceptance with monitoring and MCP tool availability.
- Ensure docs reference `docs/specs/day11-17_summary.md` for context.

### Day 12 · Deployment & Quick Start
- Embed deployment health checks into acceptance criteria.
- Reference quick-start guides in requirement packs.
- Coordinate with Tech Lead for environment readiness signals.

### Day 15 · Modular Reviewer Rollout
- Update requirements for modular reviewer feature flag and rollout plan.
- Track performance baselines and acceptance metrics for reviewer flows.
- Archive deprecated reminder/task tooling requirements.

### Day 17 · Integration Contracts & README
- Define integration coverage expectations and contract checkpoints.
- Sync README and integration notes with updated requirements.
- Align with `docs/specs/epic_03/alerting_runbook.md` for escalation data.

### Days 18-22 · Continuous Alignment
- Maintain decision logs as new MADRs emerge.
- Validate cross-team dependencies and escalate gaps.
- Prepare summaries for epic archiving and knowledge transfer.

## Capability Patterns
- **Requirement Matrices**: Use tables mapping Must/Should/Out-of-Scope to tests.
- **Traceability**: Link acceptance criteria to `tests/` paths and CI evidence.
- **Review Feedback**: Log remarks in `docs/epics/<epic>/reviews/` with timestamps.

## Upcoming (Days 23-28) ⏳
- Placeholder for new epics: capture planned scope and anticipated constraints.
- Prepare to expand RAG queries for emerging domains (e.g., analytics, billing).
- Coordinate with Architect to pre-register decision templates.

## Update Log
- [ ] EP19 – Requirements refresh pending
- [ ] EP20 – Awaiting initial scoping session
- [ ] EP21 – Sync with architecture decision queue
