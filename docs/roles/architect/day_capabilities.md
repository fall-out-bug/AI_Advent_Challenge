# Architect Day Capabilities

## Foundational Days 1-22

### Days 1-10 · Baseline Architecture
- Establish Clean Architecture enforcement checklist.
- Map domain boundaries and dependency rules.
- Document initial MADR templates and review cadence.

### Day 11 · Shared Infra & MCP Baseline
- Align architecture vision with shared services (Mongo, Prometheus, Grafana).
- Define contracts for MCP tool integrations and observability endpoints.
- Capture infra assumptions in architecture diagrams.

### Day 12 · Deployment & Quick Start
- Harden deployment topology diagrams and environment matrices.
- Validate start-up/health-check flows and surface them to Tech Lead plan.
- Confirm secrets management practices in architecture notes.

### Day 15 · Modular Reviewer Rollout
- Model modular reviewer components and feature-flag boundaries.
- Document adapter interfaces for reviewer migrations.
- Update risk register with reviewer performance constraints.

### Day 17 · Integration Contracts & README
- Publish integration contracts and API coverage matrices.
- Sync README architecture sections with canonical diagrams.
- Reserve slots for new MCP tools in architecture roadmap.

### Days 18-22 · Consolidation
- Review accumulated MADRs; mark deprecated patterns.
- Ensure cross-cutting concerns (logging, metrics, config) remain consistent.
- Prepare architecture insights for epic archive packages.

## Capability Patterns
- **MADR Lifecycle**: Draft → Review (Analyst) → Decision → Archive.
- **Boundary Audits**: Use static analysis to confirm dependency direction.
- **Risk Mapping**: Maintain risk register aligned with Tech Lead mitigation plans.

## Upcoming (Days 23-28) ⏳
- Anticipate architecture changes for new MCP tools and reviewer enhancements.
- Plan for data lineage diagrams and resiliency reviews.
- Coordinate with Tech Lead on capacity planning inputs.

## Update Log
- [ ] EP19 – Pending scope kickoff
- [ ] EP20 – Awaiting new integration outline
- [ ] EP21 – Align with modular reviewer performance metrics
