# Consolidated Task Requirements

This document consolidates requirements from all days (01-08) into unified specifications for the AI Challenge repository restructuring.

## Core Objectives

### 1. Unified Multi-Model System
**From Day 05**: Call multiple models from HuggingFace list
- Measure response time
- Count input/output tokens
- Calculate costs (if applicable)
- Support for: Qwen, Mistral, TinyLlama, StarCoder

### 2. Model Testing & Comparison
**From Day 06**: Test models on logical puzzles
- Test models in direct mode (instant answer)
- Test models in step-by-step reasoning mode
- Compare answer quality between modes
- Generate detailed comparison reports

### 3. Multi-Agent Architecture
**From Day 07**: Create two specialized agent classes
- Agent 1: Performs initial task (e.g., code generation)
- Outputs result in readable format for Agent 2
- Agent 2: Performs secondary task based on Agent 1's output (e.g., code review)
- Agents interact via structured communication

### 4. Token Analysis & Compression
**From Day 08**: Advanced token management
- Token counting (input and output)
- Compare behavior with:
  - Short requests
  - Medium requests
  - Requests exceeding model limits
- Implement text truncation/compression before sending
