# Worklog · 2025-11-09

## Activities
- Bootstrapped Epic 00 documentation (`epic_00/`, Stage 00_01 & 00_02 files, progress tracker).
- Captured architectural/operational/system specs baselines.
- Ran full test suite with shared infra endpoints; recorded failing groups.
- Introduced structured logging shim so log kwargs no longer break tests.
- Compiled MCP tool catalogue; aligned on deprecating homework review/PDF and archiving reminder flows.
- Captured product decisions: canonical sprints starting Day 11, treatment of `examples/`/`contracts/`/`tasks/`, orchestrator refactors, CLI backoffice, shared/packages roadmap.
- Summarised Day 11–17 (`docs/specs/day11-17_summary.md`); originals archived under `docs/archive/day11-17`.
- Added repository/top-level directory snapshot and MCP tool catalogue to Stage 00_01.
- Added detailed inventories for `src/presentation/mcp/tools`, `src/presentation/bot`, `src/workers`, and `shared/shared_package`.
- Confirmed modular reviewer scaffolding directories (`adapters/`, `loaders/`, `presentation/`) stay reserved for future growth.
- Tagged support areas (`docs/`, `scripts/`, `prompts/`, `examples/`, `contracts/`, `tasks/`) with Keep/Archive/Rework guidance.
- Agreed on documentation strategy: consolidated bilingual (EN/RU) references for human and agent consumption.
- Closed Stage 00_01 checklist items; stage ready for review sign-off.
- Captured initial CLI backoffice requirements (owner-only, deterministic channel/digest commands).
- Started Stage 00_02 artefacts: initial decision table and risk register populated.
- Assigned owners/follow-ups for Stage 00_02 decision table and risks (Assistant ⇄ User).
- Prepared bilingual documentation consolidation plan (Stage 00_02) and drafted `API_REVIEWER`/`API_MCP`/`API_BOT_BACKOFFICE`/`DOCS_OVERVIEW` pairs (awaiting review ✅).
- Captured Day 12 deployment quick start in Operations guide (spec alignment plan updated).
- Aligned Day 15 release notes with specs (summarisation + fine-tuning workstream recorded).
- Captured Day 17 log-analysis integration in architecture/spec alignment.
- Documented Day 11–18 spec alignment plan for Stage 00_02 execution.
- Drafted CLI backoffice command set (channels/digest/NLP operations).
- Recorded CLI wiring plan and CI test baseline proposal in Stage 00_02.
- Marked Epic 00 stages as ready for closure in progress tracker.
- Updated CI workflow to enforce agreed test baseline (Stage 00_02 completed).

## Observations
- Numerous legacy tests fail due to outdated expectations (Mongo auth, locale strings, heavy dependencies).
- PDF digest tooling needs rework or heavy mocking (WeasyPrint, logging extras).
- Reminder tools depend on Telegram flows that are slated for archival, confirming decision to remove.

## Next Steps
- Seek review/approval for Stage 00_01 inventory (all tags captured).
- Execute bilingual doc consolidation (per Stage 00_02 plan).
- Plan Epics for Day 18+ (new requirements expected tomorrow).
- Finalise CI test baseline (confirm exclusions, update pipelines).
