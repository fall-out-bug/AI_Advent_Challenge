  summary: "Direct production deployment APPROVED with enhanced safety measures"
  deployment_approval: "approved"
  approval_rationale:
    - "Epic 26 fully tested and validated (90% coverage, all acceptance criteria met)"
    - "All quality gates passed (type checking, linting, security scan)"
    - "Enhanced safety measures adequately compensate for skipping dev/staging"
    - "Strict rollback triggers provide safety net"
  safety_measures_review:
    canary_period: "APPROVED - 2 hours extended period provides adequate validation"
    canary_percentage: "APPROVED - 5% initial traffic is conservative and safe"
    gradual_rollout: "APPROVED - 5% → 25% → 50% → 100% provides controlled expansion"
    monitoring: "APPROVED - Real-time metrics every 1 minute enables rapid detection"
    rollback_triggers: "APPROVED - Strict triggers (error rate > 0.5%, latency > 60s) provide safety"
  deployment_authorization:
    direct_production: "APPROVED"
    canary_deployment: "APPROVED - 5% for 2 hours"
    gradual_rollout: "APPROVED - Step-by-step expansion plan"
    enhanced_monitoring: "APPROVED - Real-time monitoring configured"
    automatic_rollback: "APPROVED - Rollback triggers configured"
  risk_assessment:
    risk_level: "acceptable_with_enhanced_measures"
    mitigation: "Enhanced canary deployment with extended monitoring period and gradual rollout adequately mitigates risks"
    confidence: "high"
    rationale: "Epic quality (90% coverage, all tests passing) combined with enhanced safety measures makes direct production deployment acceptable"
  deployment_execution_approval:
    ready_to_execute: true
    execution_authorization: "APPROVED"
    monitoring_required: "Continuous monitoring during canary and rollout phases"
    rollback_readiness: "Automatic rollback must be ready and tested"
  notes: "Direct production deployment APPROVED. Enhanced safety measures (5% canary for 2 hours, gradual rollout, strict rollback triggers) provide adequate risk mitigation. Continuous monitoring required during deployment. Ready to execute when DevOps team is ready."

action_needed: "execute_direct_production_deployment"
