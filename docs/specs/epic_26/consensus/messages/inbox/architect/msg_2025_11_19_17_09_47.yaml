  key_points:
    - "All components mapped to correct layers (domain → application → infrastructure → presentation)"
    - "Layer boundaries respected in task dependencies"
    - "Interfaces defined for all cross-layer communication"
    - "Uses existing LLMClient Protocol (no new LLM interface)"

    - "Stage 1: Domain entities (pure, no dependencies)"
    - "Stage 2: Infrastructure adapters (depends on domain)"
    - "Stage 3: Application use cases (depends on domain + infrastructure interfaces)"
    - "Stage 4: Application orchestrator (depends on use cases)"
    - "Stage 5: Presentation CLI (depends on orchestrator)"

    - "GenerateCodeUseCase includes Clean Architecture boundary validation"
    - "All use cases depend on interfaces, not concrete implementations"
