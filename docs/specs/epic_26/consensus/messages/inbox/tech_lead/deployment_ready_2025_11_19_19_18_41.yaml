  notes: "Stage 3 contains business logic orchestration with AST-based validation and Clean Architecture boundary checks. No runtime deployment required - code is ready for merge to main branch. AST-based validation and Clean Architecture boundary checks are excellent features. External dependencies (pytest, AST) must be available in runtime environment for Stage 5. Full service deployment (monitoring, health checks, alerts) will be configured when Stage 5 (Presentation Layer - CLI) is complete."

notes: "Stage 3 is deployment-ready. Code can be merged to main branch. Developer can proceed to Stage 4 (Application Layer - Orchestrator) development. AST-based validation and Clean Architecture boundary checks are excellent features. Full runtime deployment will be planned when Stage 5 is complete."
