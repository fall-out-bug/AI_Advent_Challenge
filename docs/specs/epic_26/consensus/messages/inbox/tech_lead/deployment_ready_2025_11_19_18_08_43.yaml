  notes: "Stage 2 contains infrastructure adapters with external dependencies (pytest, subprocess, LLM client). No runtime deployment required - code is ready for merge to main branch. External dependencies (pytest) must be available in runtime environment for Stage 5. Full service deployment (monitoring, health checks, alerts) will be configured when Stage 5 (Presentation Layer - CLI) is complete."

notes: "Stage 2 is deployment-ready. Code can be merged to main branch. Developer can proceed to Stage 3 (Application Layer - Use Cases) development. External dependencies (pytest) must be installed in runtime environment for Stage 5. Full runtime deployment will be planned when Stage 5 is complete."
