  blocker: "Merge conflicts in codebase prevent test execution"
  details: |
    Completed Stage 1 implementation (all 8 tasks) following TDD:
    - T1.1-T1.2: CodeFile entity (tests + implementation)
    - T1.3-T1.4: TestCase entity (tests + implementation)
    - T1.5-T1.6: TestResult entity (tests + implementation)
    - T1.7-T1.8: TestGenerationRequest value object (tests + implementation)

    All code written, no linting errors. However, cannot run tests due to merge conflicts
    in core infrastructure files:
    - src/infrastructure/config/settings.py (multiple conflicts)
    - src/infrastructure/logging/__init__.py (conflicts)
    - src/domain/interfaces/__init__.py (conflicts)
    - tests/conftest.py (conflicts)
    - src/infrastructure/llm/prompts.py (conflicts)

    These conflicts cause SyntaxError when pytest tries to load conftest, preventing
    any test execution. The conflicts are not related to epic_26 work.
  attempted: |
    - Fixed several merge conflicts manually (settings.py, logging/__init__.py, interfaces/__init__.py)
    - Attempted to run tests in isolation
    - Verified code syntax and linting (all clean)
  need: |
    Resolution of merge conflicts in infrastructure files to enable test execution.
    Need to verify Stage 1 implementation passes all tests before proceeding to Stage 2.

    Alternative: Guidance on whether to:
    1. Continue with Stage 2 implementation (tests written but not runnable)
    2. Wait for conflict resolution
    3. Use alternative test execution method
