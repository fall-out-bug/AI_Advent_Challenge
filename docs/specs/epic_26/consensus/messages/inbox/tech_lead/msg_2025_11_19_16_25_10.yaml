  summary: "Requirements for Epic 26 (Test Agent) are ready for implementation planning"
  key_points:
    - "High technical complexity: requires LLM integration, code analysis, test generation, and execution"
    - "Must break into <4 hour tasks following TDD approach"
    - "Integration with existing pytest infrastructure required"
    - "Local Qwen model integration is critical constraint"
  concerns:
    - "Test generation quality may require iterative refinement"
    - "Code generation must respect Clean Architecture (needs careful planning)"
    - "Execution pipeline needs robust error handling"
