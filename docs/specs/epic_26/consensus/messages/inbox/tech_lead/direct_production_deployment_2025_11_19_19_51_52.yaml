  safety_measures_applied:
    - "Extended canary period: 2 hours (instead of 1 hour)"
    - "Reduced initial canary: 5% traffic (instead of 10%)"
    - "Gradual rollout: 5% → 25% → 50% → 100%"
    - "Enhanced monitoring: Real-time metrics every 1 minute"
    - "Strict rollback triggers: Error rate > 0.5% or any health check failure"
    - "Comprehensive validation: Error rate, latency, coverage, health checks"

  risk_mitigation:
    level: "enhanced"
    measures: "All safety measures applied to compensate for skipping dev/staging"
    notes: "Direct production deployment is higher risk, but enhanced canary with extended monitoring period and gradual rollout provides safety net."
