  notes: "Stage 4 coordinates complete workflow between use cases. No runtime deployment required - code is ready for merge to main branch. Perfect test coverage (100%) and excellent code quality. Orchestrator properly coordinates the complete workflow. External dependencies (pytest, AST) must be available in runtime environment for Stage 5. Full service deployment (monitoring, health checks, alerts) will be configured when Stage 5 (Presentation Layer - CLI) is complete."

notes: "Stage 4 is deployment-ready. Code can be merged to main branch. Developer can proceed to Stage 5 (Presentation Layer - CLI) development - this will be the FINAL STAGE with runtime deployment. Perfect test coverage (100%) and excellent code quality. Full runtime deployment will be planned when Stage 5 is complete."
