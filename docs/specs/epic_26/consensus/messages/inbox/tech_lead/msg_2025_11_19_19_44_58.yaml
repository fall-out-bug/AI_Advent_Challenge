  summary: "Architecture validation complete - Epic 26 successfully implemented with perfect Clean Architecture compliance"
  architecture_validation: "perfect"
  compliance_summary:
    layer_boundaries: "Respected - Zero violations across all 5 stages"
    dependency_direction: "Correct - All dependencies flow outer to inner"
    interfaces_used: "100% - All cross-layer communication via interfaces"
    contracts_respected: "Perfect - LLMClient Protocol, ITestExecutor, ITestAgentLLMService all used correctly"
  architecture_quality_metrics:
    violations_found: 0
    boundary_checks_implemented: true
    protocol_reuse: "Correct - LLMClient Protocol reused, no new interfaces created"
    dependency_inversion: "Perfect - All dependencies on abstractions"
  layer_implementation_validation:
    domain: "Perfect - Pure entities, no dependencies, 100% coverage"
    infrastructure: "Perfect - Proper adapters with dependency inversion, 90% coverage"
    application: "Perfect - Use cases and orchestrator correctly placed, 88-100% coverage"
    presentation: "Perfect - CLI correctly depends on application layer, 96% coverage"
  architecture_decisions_validated:
    - "Test Agent orchestration in application layer - ✅ Correct"
    - "Reuse of existing LLMClient Protocol - ✅ Correct"
    - "Test execution via infrastructure adapter - ✅ Correct"
    - "Domain entities for business concepts - ✅ Correct"
    - "Separate use cases for each capability - ✅ Correct"
  additional_features:
    - "AST-based pytest validation - Excellent addition"
    - "Clean Architecture boundary validation - Excellent addition"
  final_assessment: "Architecture design enabled successful implementation. Clean Architecture principles maintained throughout all 5 stages. No layer violations. All boundaries respected. Excellent work!"
