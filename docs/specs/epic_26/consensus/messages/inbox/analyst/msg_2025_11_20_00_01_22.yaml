  summary: "Iteration 3 plan created to address production issue with function redefinitions"
  iteration: 3
  total_hours: 12
  stages: 5

  context:
    production_issue: "LLM generates function redefinitions that leak through filters, causing syntax errors in generated tests"
    root_cause: "Multi-pass approach implemented but redefinitions still leak through validation"
    approach: "Comprehensive fix with debug logging, source code protection, enhanced validation"

  plan_highlights:
    - "Stage 1: Add debug logging to track LLM output and filtering operations"
    - "Stage 2: Implement immutable source code section protection"
    - "Stage 3: Enhance AST-based validation at multiple stages"
    - "Stage 4: Improve filtering to catch all redefinition patterns"
    - "Stage 5: E2E testing with debug output analysis"

  requirements_compliance:
    - "All changes maintain existing acceptance criteria"
    - "Test coverage target remains ≥80%"
    - "No changes to requirements, only implementation improvements"
    - "Backward compatibility maintained"

  validation_needed:
    - "Review plan for requirements compliance"
    - "Verify acceptance criteria are still met"
    - "Confirm no scope creep"

action_needed: "review_plan_for_requirements_compliance"
notes: "This iteration addresses a production bug without changing requirements. The plan focuses on improving implementation quality and fixing the function redefinition issue. Please review to ensure all requirements are still met."
