  summary: "Test samples validation complete - All 4 samples APPROVED for production use"
  validation_status: "approved"
  samples_reviewed: 4
  samples_approved: 4
  samples_requiring_changes: 0
  validation_details:
    - "01_simple_functions.py - Level 1 (Simple) - APPROVED"
    - "02_calculator.py - Level 2 (Medium) - APPROVED"
    - "03_shopping_cart.py - Level 3 (Hard) - APPROVED"
    - "04_data_processor.py - Level 4 (Complex) - APPROVED"
  complexity_coverage:
    levels_covered: [1, 2, 3, 4]
    assessment: "excellent"
    progression: "appropriate (simple → complex)"
  acceptance_criteria_coverage:
    AC1: "COVERED - All samples require pytest test generation"
    AC2: "NOT APPLICABLE - Samples are standalone code (no Clean Architecture layers). AC2 will be tested with real project files."
    AC3: "COVERED - All samples require test execution and coverage reporting"
    AC4: "COVERED - All samples will use local Qwen model"
    AC5: "VERIFIABLE - All samples can achieve ≥80% coverage"
  sample_quality_assessment:
    type_hints: "100% coverage - All samples have type hints"
    docstrings: "100% coverage - All samples have docstrings"
    edge_cases: "Good coverage - Division by zero, empty lists, None values, state management"
    code_standards: "Excellent - All samples follow PEP 8, type hints, docstrings"
  production_readiness:
    status: "approved"
    rationale: "Samples cover appropriate complexity levels and test all relevant acceptance criteria. Well-designed for production validation."
  recommendations:
    - "No changes required - samples are production-ready"
    - "AC2 (Clean Architecture validation) should be tested separately with real project files (e.g., src/domain/test_agent/entities/code_file.py)"
  artifacts_created:
    - "test_samples_validation.json - Complete validation report"
  next_steps:
    - "Developer can proceed with implementing verification scripts"
    - "Verification scripts should run Test Agent against all 4 samples"
    - "Scripts should verify coverage ≥80% for each sample"

action_needed: "none"
notes: "Test samples validation complete. All 4 samples approved for production use. No changes required. Developer can proceed with verification script implementation."
