  summary: "Merge conflicts in src/infrastructure/clients/llm_client.py resolved - import now works"
  blocker_status: "resolved"
  resolved_file: "src/infrastructure/clients/llm_client.py"
  conflicts_resolved: 15
  resolution_strategy:
    - "Kept origin/master version with stop_sequences parameter (matches LLMClient Protocol)"
    - "Added stop_sequences to all generate() methods: HTTPLLMClient, FallbackLLMClient, ResilientLLMClient"
    - "Added batch_generate() methods to HTTPLLMClient and FallbackLLMClient"
    - "All conflicts resolved while maintaining backward compatibility"
  verification:
    - "Import test successful: from src.infrastructure.llm.clients.llm_client import LLMClient"
    - "Syntax errors resolved - Python AST parsing successful"
    - "Import chain verified: llm_client.py → resilient_client.py → clients/llm_client.py"
  next_steps:
    - "Run Stage 2 tests: pytest tests/unit/infrastructure/test_agent/ -v"
    - "Verify T2.4 (TestAgentLLMService implementation) can import LLMClient Protocol"
    - "Complete Stage 2 testing and verify all 6 tasks (T2.1-T2.6) pass"
    - "Check test coverage: pytest tests/unit/infrastructure/test_agent/ --cov=src/infrastructure/test_agent --cov-report=term-missing"
    - "If all tests pass, proceed to Stage 3 (Application Layer)"
  notes:
    - "Merge conflicts were in infrastructure files unrelated to epic_26 work"
    - "All conflicts resolved while preserving functionality and Protocol compatibility"
    - "TestAgentLLMService should now be able to import and use LLMClient Protocol"
