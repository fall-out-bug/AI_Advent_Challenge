  expected_outcome:
    - "All voice module exports verified and correct"
    - "No missing exports or incorrect names"
    - "All voice-related imports work correctly"
    - "Tests pass (if voice tests exist)"

  notes: |
    This is a low-priority task identified during merge conflict review.
    The issue may be:
    1. VoiceCommandDTO was renamed to something else
    2. VoiceCommandDTO is not needed (legacy code)
    3. Export name is different than expected

    If voice module is not critical for current epic, this can be deferred.
