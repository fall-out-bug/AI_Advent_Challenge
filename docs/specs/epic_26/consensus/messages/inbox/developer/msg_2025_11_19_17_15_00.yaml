  summary: "Implementation plan approved and ready for development"
  key_points:
    - "Plan follows TDD strictly - write tests first, then implementation"
    - "All tasks are <4 hours (max 2 hours) - well broken down"
    - "Follow Clean Architecture layer order: Domain → Infrastructure → Application → Presentation"
    - "All acceptance criteria mapped to specific tasks"
  implementation_guidance:
    - "Start with Stage 1: Domain Layer (pure entities, no dependencies)"
    - "Follow task dependencies strictly - don't skip ahead"
    - "Ensure 80% test coverage for each stage before proceeding"
    - "Use existing LLMClient Protocol (no new LLM interface needed)"
    - "Validate Clean Architecture boundaries in GenerateCodeUseCase (T3.4)"
    - "Validate pytest syntax in GenerateTestsUseCase (T3.2) using AST"
  clarification_needed:
    - "During T3.2: Clarify exact AST validation approach for pytest syntax"
    - "During T3.4: Clarify exact validation approach for Clean Architecture boundaries"
