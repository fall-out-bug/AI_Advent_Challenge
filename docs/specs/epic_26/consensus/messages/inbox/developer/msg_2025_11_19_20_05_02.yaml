    functionality:
      - "Iterate over all 4 sample files"
      - "Run Test Agent CLI for each file: python -m src.presentation.cli.test_agent.main <file_path>"
      - "Collect results: test status (pass/fail), coverage percentage, errors"
      - "Verify coverage ≥80% for each sample"

  test_requirements:
    - "Verification script itself must have ≥80% test coverage"
    - "Script must follow project code standards (PEP 8, type hints, docstrings)"
    - "Script must be executable standalone"
  time_constraint: "Script implementation should complete within 2 hours"
