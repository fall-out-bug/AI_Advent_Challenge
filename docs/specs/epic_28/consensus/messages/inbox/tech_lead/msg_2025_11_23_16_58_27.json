    "subject": "Deployment.json created - Epic 28 blocked by quality veto",
    "summary": "Created deployment.json with deployment strategy, rollback plans, monitoring setup. Status: BLOCKED due to quality veto (implementation.json missing, code not implemented). Deployment stages defined (staging → canary → production), but unblocking requires code implementation and passing quality gates.",
    "key_points": [
      "Deployment.json created per consensus_architecture.json::artifacts.deployment",
      "Status: BLOCKED - quality veto (see review.json)",
      "Deployment strategy: staged rollout (staging → canary → production)",
      "Rollback plans: per-task (revert commit), full (revert all commits), partial (revert workstream commits)",
      "Monitoring: 6 Prometheus metrics (god_agent_tasks_total, plan_duration_seconds, veto_total, skill_latency_seconds, memory_retrieval_seconds, intent_routing_seconds), 3 Grafana dashboards, 7 alerts",
      "Health checks: /health/ready (dependencies), /health/live (liveness)",
      "Dependencies: shared infra (MongoDB, Prometheus, LLM API, RAG pipeline, Telegram bot), internal use cases (no changes)",
      "Deployment readiness checklist: 6 categories (code, tests, quality_gates, infrastructure, observability, rollback)"
    ],
    "concerns": [
      "Deployment blocked until quality veto is resolved",
      "Requires implementation.json with code_refs",
      "Requires test_evidence (coverage >= 80%, integration tests, smoke tests)",
      "Requires security tests (input sanitization)",
      "Requires performance tests (< 150ms memory, < 5s intent, < 30s multi-step)",
      "Requires layer boundary validation in CI"
    ],
    "action_needed": "Coordinate with developer for code implementation per plan.json. After receiving implementation.json and test_evidence, conduct re-review with quality. Deployment can only be unblocked after passing quality gates (release_gate: true)."
  }
