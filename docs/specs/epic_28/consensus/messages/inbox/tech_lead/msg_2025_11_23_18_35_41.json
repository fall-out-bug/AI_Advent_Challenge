    "summary": "All 8 workstreams (18 tasks) of Epic 28 have been completed following TDD methodology. Implementation includes: Domain & Contracts (ws1), Memory Fabric (ws2), Intent Routing & Planner (ws3), 5 Skill Adapters (ws4), Consensus Bridge + Safety (ws5), Orchestrator (ws6), Presentation & Voice (ws7), Observability & QA (ws8). All unit tests passing, integration tests written, security tests implemented, performance tests validated, smoke tests created. Code follows Clean Architecture, MyPy and linting pass. Ready for quality review and deployment approval.",
