    "subject": "Requirements ready for planning - Epic 28 God Agent Alfred",
    "summary": "Requirements.json prepared for Epic 28. Need implementation plan sequencing workstreams: domain contracts, memory fabric, intent routing, skill adapters, consensus bridge, presentation integration, observability.",
    "key_points": [
      "7 workstreams identified: Domain & Contracts, Memory Fabric + Persona Merge, Intent Routing & Planner, Skill Adapters (5 skills), Consensus Bridge + Safety, Presentation & Voice, Observability & QA",
      "Acceptance criteria require smoke tests covering at least one flow per skill",
      "Performance targets: < 5s for concierge, < 30s for multi-step flows, < 150ms memory retrieval",
      "Token budgets from role prompts must be respected by planner",
      "Reuse existing test fixtures and use cases; skill adapters should call existing application layer services",
      "Pet project context: owner will manually test and provide feedback; no automated simulation scripts"
    ],
    "concerns": [
      "Plan depth: need hard cap on plan depth + watchdog timers to prevent runaway tasks",
      "Skill drift: ensure adapters call existing use cases to avoid regressions",
      "Memory bloat: need summary compression + TTL policies to stay within token budgets",
      "Consensus latency: async queue + notifications required; only critical steps trigger full consensus",
      "Test coverage: minimum 80% required per project rules; unit + integration + smoke tests needed"
    ],
    "action_needed": "Read requirements.json and architecture.json (once available), then emit plan.json with workstream sequencing, ETA estimates, risk mitigations, and testing strategy. Ensure test coverage ≥ 0.6 for auto-approval."
