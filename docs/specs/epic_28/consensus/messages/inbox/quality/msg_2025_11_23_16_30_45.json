    "summary": "Requirements.json prepared for Epic 28. User testing strategy defined: owner will manually test scenarios and provide feedback. Need quality gates for testability, security, and coverage.",
    "key_points": [
      "User testing: manual testing by project owner; 7 scenarios defined (concierge, research, builder, reviewer, ops, multi-step, consensus bridge)",
      "E2E required: smoke tests covering at least one flow per skill",
      "Acceptance criteria: 12 explicit ACs with measurable outcomes",
      "Security: stay local (Mongo, Prometheus, Qwen), no external SaaS dependencies",
      "Observability: Prometheus metrics + structured logs required for all task steps",
      "Safety guardrails: veto rules from consensus_architecture.json must be enforced"
    ],
    "concerns": [
      "Test coverage: minimum 80% required per project rules; ensure unit + integration + smoke tests",
      "Security gaps: validate input sanitization for user messages, voice transcripts, CLI commands",
      "Missing tests: verify all acceptance criteria have corresponding test cases",
      "User testing: owner feedback will be qualitative; need structured way to capture and act on feedback"
    ],
    "action_needed": "Review requirements.json, plan.json (once available), and implementation.json (once available). Emit review.json with verdict, coverage metrics, security assessment, and release gate decision. Ensure no security issues and user tests are defined."
