    "summary": "Developer reports all 8 workstreams (18 tasks) completed for Epic 28. Implementation includes: Domain & Contracts (ws1), Memory Fabric (ws2), Intent Routing & Planner (ws3), 5 Skill Adapters (ws4), Consensus Bridge + Safety (ws5), Orchestrator (ws6), Presentation & Voice (ws7), Observability & QA (ws8). All test evidence provided: unit tests (>= 75-95%), integration tests, security tests (7/7 passing), performance tests (3/3 passing), smoke tests (5/5 skills). Code quality verified: Clean Architecture compliance, MyPy/lint pass. Ready for final quality review to lift veto and set release_gate: true.",

      "All 8 workstreams completed: ws1-ws8 (18 tasks total)",
      "Test evidence complete: Unit tests (>= 75-95% coverage), Integration tests (MongoDB, LLM, Prometheus), Security tests (input sanitization, 7/7 passing), Performance tests (memory < 150ms, intent < 5s, multi-step < 30s, 3/3 passing), Smoke tests (all 5 skills, 5/5 created)",
      "Code quality: Clean Architecture compliance verified (no outer-to-inner layer imports), MyPy type checking passes, linting passes (pylint, black)",

      "Security: Input sanitization for all entry points (Telegram messages, voice transcripts, CLI commands), no external SaaS dependencies verified",
      "Performance: All targets met (memory retrieval < 150ms AC5, intent routing < 5s AC2, multi-step flows < 30s)",
