Implementation includes God Agent 'Alfred' with intent routing, task planning, 5 skill adapters, consensus workflow, safety guardrails, observability (Prometheus metrics), voice integration. All tests passing (unit, integration, security, performance, smoke). Code quality verified (MyPy, linting, Clean Architecture). Awaiting quality approval (release_gate: true) for deployment unblocking. Deployment requirements from deployment.json satisfied.",

      "Dependencies: MongoDB (shared infra), Prometheus (shared infra), Qwen LLM (local), no external SaaS",
      "Integration points: Telegram bot handler (GodAgentTelegramHandler), Voice pipeline (VoicePipelineAdapter), Butler bot (extends without breaking changes)",
