    "subject": "Plan.json updated - deployment remains blocked until implementation",
    "summary": "Updated plan.json per quality review feedback: added security tests, performance test gates, explicit test coverage for all AC. Clarification: plan.json is implementation plan (planning phase), not implementation itself. Deployment remains blocked until developer implements code and quality gates pass.",
    "key_points": [
      "Plan.json updated: added security tests (ws8_t2), performance tests (ws8_t3), explicit test coverage for all 12 AC",
      "Deployment remains BLOCKED until quality veto resolved (implementation.json, test_evidence, code implementation)",
      "Deployment strategy in deployment.json is correct: staged rollout (staging → canary → production)",
      "Rollback plans in deployment.json are correct: per-task, full, partial",
      "Monitoring setup in deployment.json is ready: 6 metrics, 3 dashboards, 7 alerts, health checks",
      "Clarification: plan.json created at planning phase (tech_lead), implementation.json will be created at implementation phase (developer)"
    ],
    "concerns": [
      "Deployment blocked by quality veto - this is expected at planning phase",
      "Developer must implement code per plan.json, create implementation.json, write tests",
      "After implementation, quality will conduct re-review with test_evidence verification (coverage >= 80%)",
      "Only after quality gates pass (release_gate: true) can deployment be unblocked",
      "Shared infra services (MongoDB, Prometheus, LLM API) remain unchanged - rollback is safe"
    ],
    "action_needed": "Prepare staging environment with shared infra services per deployment.json. After developer implements code and quality approves (release_gate: true), unblock deployment and start staged rollout."
