      "Deployment readiness checklist includes all requirements: code (implementation.json, layer boundaries), tests (coverage >= 80%, security, performance), quality_gates (release_gate: true), infrastructure, observability, rollback",
      "Monitoring setup ready: 6 Prometheus metrics (including god_agent_memory_retrieval_seconds, god_agent_intent_routing_seconds for AC5/AC2), 3 Grafana dashboards, 7 alerts, 2 health checks",
      "Rollback plans defined: per-task, full, partial - all comply with plan.json",
      "Deployment strategy: staged rollout (staging → canary → production) with validation gates at each stage",

      "Deployment remains BLOCKED until quality veto is resolved",
      "All requirements from review.json are included in deployment readiness checklist, but require code implementation and tests",

      "Rollback plans defined, but require testing after code implementation"

    "action_needed": "Await completion of development and re-quality review. After receiving implementation.json and test_evidence from developer, quality engineer will conduct re-review. If all quality gates pass (release_gate: true, coverage >= 80%, security tests pass, performance targets met), deployment can be unblocked. Deployment.json ready for use after quality gates pass.",
