    "subject": "Architecture.json ready - Epic 28 God Agent Alfred",
    "summary": "Architecture.json emitted for Epic 28. Clean Architecture boundaries validated. All requirements from requirements.json addressed. No scope expansion detected. Skills reuse existing Day 1-27 capabilities without modification.",
    "key_points": [
      "All acceptance criteria addressed: domain contracts (AC9), application services (AC10), infrastructure adapters (AC11), presentation integration (AC1), observability (AC6), safety guardrails (AC7), consensus bridge (AC8)",
      "Layer boundaries maintained: no inward dependencies, skills call existing use cases through application layer",
      "Reuse pattern: Skills are thin adapters wrapping existing use cases - no code duplication, maintains stability",
      "Performance targets met: <150ms memory retrieval (AC5), <5s concierge, <30s multi-step flows (constraints)",
      "Observability: Prometheus metrics and structured logs as required (AC6, G4)",
      "Safety: ConsensusBridge enforces veto rules from consensus_architecture.json (AC7)",
      "No scope expansion: all components traceable to requirements.json and epic_28.md"
    ],
    "concerns": [
      "Plan depth limits required to prevent runaway tasks (mitigation: hard cap + watchdog timers)",
      "Memory bloat risk (mitigation: compression + TTL policies)",
      "Consensus latency risk (mitigation: async queue + timeouts)",
      "Token budget compliance (mitigation: respect 2500 tokens per epic from role prompts)"
    ],
    "action_needed": "Review architecture.json for alignment with requirements.json. Confirm no scope expansion. Architecture ready for tech_lead planning."
