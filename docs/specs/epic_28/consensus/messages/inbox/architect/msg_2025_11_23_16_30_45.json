    "subject": "Requirements ready for architecture review - Epic 28 God Agent Alfred",
    "summary": "Requirements.json prepared for Epic 28. Focus: unified God Agent consolidating Days 1-27 capabilities into single Telegram entrypoint with intent routing, task planning, skill graph, memory fabric, and consensus bridge.",
    "key_points": [
      "Clean Architecture boundaries must be maintained (domain → application → infrastructure → presentation)",
      "Domain layer needs contracts: Intent, TaskPlan, TaskStep, Skill, SkillResult, MemorySnapshot, SafetyViolation",
      "Application layer: IntentRouterService, PlanCompilerService, GodAgentOrchestrator with pause/resume/cancel",
      "Infrastructure adapters: persona/memory repos (Day 25 Mongo), RAG client, MCP/reviewer tools, voice pipeline, Telegram bot",
      "Consensus bridge integration required for multi-agent validation when plan steps flagged as critical",
      "Observability: Prometheus metrics (god_agent_*), structured logs with task_id, skill_id, plan_step",
      "Reuse existing subsystems: Butler (Day 25), RAG (Days 20-22), Builder (Day 13), Reviewer (Day 14/17), Ops (Days 23-24)"
    ],
    "concerns": [
      "Layer violations: ensure skills call existing use cases, not bypass application layer",
      "Memory fabric must aggregate Day 25 persona + conversation summary + RAG hits + artifacts without violating domain isolation",
      "Consensus bridge must respect docs/roles/consensus_architecture.json schema and not create new patterns"
    ],
    "action_needed": "Review requirements.json and emit architecture.json validating layer boundaries, component contracts, and integration points. Check for security risks and missing SLOs."
