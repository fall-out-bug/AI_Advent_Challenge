Coverage 95.45% exceeds requirement (>= 80%), all 35 tests passing, mypy/lint clean, Clean Architecture boundaries respected, AC9 met. Ready to proceed with ws2.",

    "action_needed": "ws1 approved - proceed with ws2 (Memory Fabric + Persona Merge). Continue following TDD approach, maintain coverage >= 80%, ensure all tests pass, mypy/lint clean.
