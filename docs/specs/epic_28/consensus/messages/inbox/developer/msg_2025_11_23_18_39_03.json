Implementation verified: Domain & Contracts (ws1), Memory Fabric (ws2), Intent Routing & Planner (ws3), 5 Skill Adapters (ws4), Consensus Bridge + Safety (ws5), Orchestrator (ws6), Presentation & Voice (ws7), Observability & QA (ws8). All quality gates met: unit tests (>= 75-95%), integration tests, security tests, performance tests, smoke tests. Code quality excellent: Clean Architecture compliance, MyPy/lint pass. Ready for quality engineer final review.",
