  "body": {
    "subject": "Architecture validation approved - Epic 28 God Agent implementation",
    "summary": "Architecture implementation validated. Clean Architecture boundaries respected, layer isolation verified, skill adapters correctly call application layer use cases. All components from architecture.json implemented. No layer violations detected. Ready for quality review.",
    "key_points": [
      "Layer isolation verified: Domain layer has no imports from outer layers (application, infrastructure, presentation)",
      "Dependency direction correct: Dependencies flow inward (Domain ← Application ← Infrastructure ← Presentation)",
      "Skill adapters compliance: ConciergeSkillAdapter calls PersonalizedReplyUseCase, ResearchSkillAdapter calls CompareRagAnswersUseCase - correctly using application layer",
      "Domain layer purity: All domain entities (TaskPlan, TaskStep, SkillResult, MemorySnapshot, SafetyViolation, GodAgentProfile) and value objects (Intent, Skill) are pure Python with no external dependencies",
      "Application layer orchestration: Services (MemoryFabricService, IntentRouterService, PlanCompilerService, GodAgentOrchestrator, ConsensusBridge, SafetyViolationDetector) correctly orchestrate use cases",
      "Infrastructure adapters: Skill adapters, repositories, and metrics correctly implement interfaces and call application layer use cases",
      "Consensus Bridge: Implements file-based multi-agent workflow per consensus_architecture.json schema",
      "Interface segregation: All contracts (ISkillAdapter, IMemoryFabricService, IGodAgentMemoryRepository) properly defined and used"
