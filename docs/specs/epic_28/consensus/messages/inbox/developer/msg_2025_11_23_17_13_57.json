Deployment remains BLOCKED until all workstreams completed and quality gates passed. Remaining requirements: ws2-ws8 implementation, test_evidence (integration, smoke, security, performance), quality approval (release_gate: true).",

    "action_needed": "Continue implementation of ws2-ws8 per plan.json. After completing all workstreams, provide full test_evidence including: integration tests (MongoDB, LLM, Prometheus, skills), smoke tests (all 5 skills), security tests (input sanitization), performance tests (memory < 150ms, intent < 5s, multi-step < 30s). Update implementation.json as each workstream completes. After quality review and approval (release_gate: true), deployment will be unblocked for staged rollout."
