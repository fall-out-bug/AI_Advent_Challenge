# Stage 04_03 · Repository Hygiene & Sign-Off

## Goal
Finalise repository clean-up, update navigation artefacts, and capture lessons
learned to close the epic.

## Checklist
- [ ] Update top-level README, documentation indices, and progress tracker to
  reflect the new canonical structure.
- [ ] Review archive folders for completeness (README, metadata, access notes).
- [ ] Perform final repository audit (lint, tests, doc links) to ensure no
  dangling references remain.
- [ ] Compile closure report summarising work completed, remaining risks, and
  recommended follow-ups.
- [ ] Obtain stakeholder sign-off (architecture, product, operations).
- [ ] Publish disaster recovery drill schedule and ownership notes derived from
  EP03 follow-ups.

## Deliverables
- Updated repository documentation and indices.
- Closure report stored under `docs/specs/epic_04/`.
- Signed-off checklist or meeting notes confirming acceptance.
- DR drill calendar and escalation summary linked from operations docs.

## Metrics & Evidence
- Automated doc link checker or manual verification logs.
- CI/lint reports confirming clean state post-cleanup.
- Summary of archived assets with final locations.

## Dependencies
- Completion of Stage 04_02 migrations.
- Availability of documentation maintainers and stakeholders.

## Exit Criteria
- Documentation merged, trackers updated, stakeholders approve closure.
- No outstanding TODOs or blockers tied to EP04; remaining items assigned to
  future epics if necessary.
- Lessons learned captured for future archival efforts.
- Disaster recovery drill cadence communicated and logged.

## Open Questions
- Should we schedule periodic audits to ensure archive remains tidy?
- Are there automation opportunities for archive inventory generation?
