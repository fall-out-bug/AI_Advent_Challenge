# Stage 04_01 · Archive Scope Confirmation

## Goal
Produce an authoritative list of assets slated for archival or deletion, along
with dependency analysis and communication plans.

## Checklist
- [ ] Review Stage 00 inventories and updates from EP01–EP03.
- [ ] Confirm replacements or successors for each legacy asset.
- [ ] Map dependencies (code references, docs links, automation scripts).
- [ ] Draft communication plan for stakeholders (what moves, when, impact).
- [ ] Validate archive folder structure and naming conventions.

## Deliverables
- Archive scope document (tables per asset type) with status and successor
  references.
- Dependency map capturing blockers or special handling.
- Communication timeline and stakeholder contact list.

## Metrics & Evidence
- Search results confirming absence of critical dependencies on assets marked
  for removal.
- Signoffs from relevant epic leads (EP01–EP03) confirming readiness.

## Dependencies
- Latest outputs from EP01–EP03.
- Access to repository search tools (CI, static analysis).
- Stakeholder availability for review.

## Exit Criteria
- Archive scope document approved by tech lead and coordination board.
- No outstanding blockers preventing migration (or blockers recorded with plan).
- Communication plan scheduled with responsible owners.

## Open Questions
- Do we keep certain assets in-place but hidden (e.g., via feature flags)?
- Are there compliance requirements dictating retention duration or location?
