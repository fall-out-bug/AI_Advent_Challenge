# Day 18 · Performance Benchmarks

## Scope
- Measure and document reviewer/summarisation performance.
- Capture latency/throughput metrics and publish results.

## Where to Look
- Benchmarks: `docs/reference/en/PERFORMANCE_BENCHMARKS.md`
- Observability: `docs/specs/epic_03/` (metrics inventory, alerting runbook)

## Outcomes
- Baseline latency snapshots recorded (Prometheus/Grafana).
- Documentation updated with benchmark sections.

## Next
- Recalibrate thresholds as system evolves (tracked under EP23).
