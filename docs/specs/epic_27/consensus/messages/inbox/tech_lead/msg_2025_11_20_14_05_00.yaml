  summary: "Requirements for Epic 27 (Local Test Agent quality on large modules) are ready for review"
  key_points:
    - "Local Qwen-based Test Agent must generate unit and integration tests for whole modules/packages, not just single files."
    - "Comparison with Cursor-agent tests is required at the coverage level, while keeping runtime strictly local in production."
  concerns:
    - "Need a robust chunking/streaming strategy for 4000-token context so that large modules can be processed without excessive complexity or instability."
