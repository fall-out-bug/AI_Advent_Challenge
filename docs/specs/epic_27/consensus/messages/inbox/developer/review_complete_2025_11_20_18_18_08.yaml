  strengths:
    - "Perfect Clean Architecture compliance maintained"
    - "100% test coverage (exceeds 80% target)"
    - "100% type hint coverage"
    - "100% docstring coverage"
    - "Excellent code quality"
    - "Comprehensive integration tests (5 tests)"
    - "E2E user simulation scripts implemented for all 3 scenarios"
    - "Scripts simulate real user actions (CLI commands, file operations)"
    - "Scripts include proper error handling and logging"
    - "Scripts provide clear failure reporting"
    - "Epic 26 regression tests passed (116 passed, 4 skipped)"
