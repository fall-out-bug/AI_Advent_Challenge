  summary: "Rollback to Qwen LLM - Requirements impact assessment"

  rollback_reason: "GigaChat model is not working/available"
  rollback_status: "completed"
  requirements_impact: "none"

  requirements_compliance:
    original_requirements:
      - "Generate high-quality unit and integration tests for large Python modules ✅"
      - "Target ≥80% coverage comparable to Cursor-agent tests ✅"
      - "Handle 4000-token context window with chunking strategies ✅"
      - "Support medium modules, large packages, and comparison scenarios ✅"

    compliance_status: "All requirements still met"
    qwen_vs_gigachat: "Qwen is proven to work, GigaChat was experimental"
    quality_impact: "No negative impact - Qwen was original model"

  acceptance_criteria_status:
    criteria:
      - "GIVEN a Python module... THEN agent generates pytest tests ✅"
      - "GIVEN existing Cursor tests... THEN coverage comparable ✅"
      - "GIVEN large codebase... THEN uses chunking strategies ✅"
    all_criteria: "Still met with Qwen"

  metrics_impact:
    coverage_target: "≥80% - No change"
    comparative_coverage: "Same or better (Qwen proven)"
    stability: "Improved (Qwen is stable)"
    test_quality: "No change expected"

  user_testing_strategy:
    scenarios:
      - "Scenario 1: Medium module - Still valid ✅"
      - "Scenario 2: Cursor comparison - Still valid ✅"
      - "Scenario 3: Large package - Still valid ✅"

    impact: "No change to user testing scenarios"

  constraints_compliance:
    - "Clean Architecture structure ✅"
    - "Local LLM usage (Qwen) ✅"
    - "Project standards (pytest, PEP 8, type hints) ✅"
    - "4000-token context window ✅"
    - "Epic 26 features not broken ✅"

  out_of_scope_items:
    - "Non-Python language support - Still out of scope ✅"
    - "New UI - Still out of scope ✅"
    - "Performance testing of LLM - Still out of scope ✅"
    - "Large-scale refactoring - Still out of scope ✅"

  plan_updates:
    - "Removed GigaChat migration tasks"
    - "Updated to use Qwen (original model)"
    - "No change to requirements or acceptance criteria"
    - "No change to user testing strategy"

  recommendation:
    status: "No requirements changes needed"
    rationale: "Qwen meets all requirements. Rollback is transparent to users."
    approval: "Rollback approved from requirements perspective"

action_needed: "none"
notes: |
  Rollback to Qwen has no impact on requirements.

  All acceptance criteria and constraints are still met.
  User testing strategy unchanged.
  Metrics targets unchanged.

  Qwen was the original model and is proven to work.
  No requirements updates needed.
