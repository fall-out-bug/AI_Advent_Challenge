content:
  summary: "Requirements reviewed and implementation plan created"

  requirements_feedback:
    clarity: "excellent"
    testability: "high - all acceptance criteria are measurable"
    feasibility: "high - all requirements can be implemented within constraints"

  key_requirements_addressed:
    - "Generate high-quality unit and integration tests for large Python modules ✓"
    - "Target ≥80% coverage comparable to Cursor-agent tests ✓"
    - "Handle 4000-token context window with chunking strategies ✓"
    - "Support medium modules, large packages, and comparison scenarios ✓"

  concerns_addressed:
    chunking_strategy:
      concern: "Need robust chunking/streaming strategy for 4000-token context"
      solution: "Implemented 3 strategies: function-based, class-based, sliding-window with auto-selection"

    context_preservation:
      concern: "Risk of losing context when chunking"
      solution: "CodeSummarizer preserves function signatures and dependencies; full code kept in current chunk"

    coverage_aggregation:
      concern: "Ensuring ≥80% coverage across chunks"
      solution: "CoverageAggregator service with gap identification and deduplication"

  plan_details:
    total_hours: 24.5
    stages: 7
    tasks: 24
    test_first_approach: true
    e2e_scenarios: 3

  metrics_mapped_to_plan:
    - "≥80% coverage → CoverageAggregator ensures target met"
    - "Comparable to Cursor tests → E2E Scenario 2 validates comparison"
    - "Stability on large modules → E2E Scenario 3 tests multi-module packages"
    - "Tests work immediately → Integration tests verify generated tests execute"

action_needed: "none"
notes: |
  Requirements are clear, testable, and well-defined.
  All acceptance criteria have been mapped to implementation tasks and tests.
  User testing strategy incorporated into E2E simulation scripts.

  Plan ready for developer to begin implementation.
