  summary: "Requirements for Epic 27 (Local Test Agent quality on large modules) are ready for review"
  key_points:
    - "User-facing goal is that locally generated tests run and pass immediately, with coverage comparable to tests written by Cursor agents."
    - "E2E testing must include scenarios where the agent is run on module- and package-level directories and results are compared against existing test suites."
  concerns:
    - "Need clear, automated ways to compare coverage and basic failure rates between local and Cursor-agent-generated tests without adding flaky checks."
