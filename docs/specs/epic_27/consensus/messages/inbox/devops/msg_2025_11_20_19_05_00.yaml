notes: |
  Epic 27 deployment successfully acknowledged!

  This epic successfully enhanced the Test Agent with:
  - Large module support via code chunking
  - Context preservation via summarization
  - Coverage aggregation and gap identification
  - GigaChat LLM integration
  - Complete E2E user simulation testing

  All quality gates passed, all tests passing, production deployment successful.

  Service is healthy and ready for use. Monitor production metrics as recommended.
