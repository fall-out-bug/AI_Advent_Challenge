# Stage 19_05 · Reference Linkage & Knowledge Hand-off

## Goal
Consolidate key specifications from Epics 00–06 and make them easily accessible
for the Document Embedding Index demo and future maintainers.

## Checklist
- [x] Catalogue core specifications that informed repository alignment, reviewer
  hardening, MCP consolidation, observability, archival cleanup, benchmarking,
  and repository hygiene.
- [x] Produce a single reference file (`stage_19_05_spec_inventory.md`) listing
  each spec with scope notes and relevance to EP19.
- [x] Link the spec inventory from the demo plan and maintainer playbook.
- [x] Ensure bilingual documentation references (EN/RU) are captured where
  applicable.

## Deliverables
- Spec inventory markdown table (expanded with owners and key decisions).
- Demo plan (`docs/specs/epic_19/demo_plan.md`) referencing the inventory.
- Note in Stage 19_04 summary pointing to the inventory for context.
- Maintainer playbook cross-reference (handled via README updates in Epic closure).

## Exit Criteria
- Inventory reviewed (you) and accepted as the canonical list of supporting
  specs for EP19.
- Demo recording references the inventory when introducing context.
- Maintainer playbook updated with link to inventory.

## Evidence
- `docs/specs/epic_19/stage_19_05_spec_inventory.md`
- `docs/specs/epic_19/demo_plan.md`
- `docs/specs/epic_19/stage_19_04_report.md` (updated with inventory pointer and MiniLM embedding notes)
